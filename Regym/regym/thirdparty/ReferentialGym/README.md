# ReferentialGym: Framework for Language Emergence/Grounding using Referential Games

This framework provides out-of-the-box implementations of Referential Games variants in order to study the emergence of artificial languages using deep learning, relying on [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org). 
This framework has been in constant development since July 2019.
The following paper details its main features:
