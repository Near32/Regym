## Referential Games with Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax Estimator

This directory contains code and experiments that study the impact of parameterizing the communication channel of a referential game using the Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax estimator.
It contains code for the following paper:

### How to run experiments?

Every experiments rely on a set of scripts found in the `scripts` directory, which contains `symoblic` --for experiments with symbolic stimuli-- and `visual` --with visual stimuli-- directories.
Each script describes its expected arguments (and default values), and the relevant sections of the paper and appendices should be enough to diffuse any doubts.
